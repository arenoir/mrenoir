I am conducting an ESRC-DTP funded research project in collaboration with the Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe (NCRNT) in Northern California, looking into the history of US land institutions, 19th and 20th century federal Indian policy, and violence against the NCRNT, with the aim of informing and expanding our understanding of the relationships between federalism, Western property institutions and intractable land conflicts.
