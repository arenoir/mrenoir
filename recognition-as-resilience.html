<p>Resilience has been conceptualized within international development studies as the ability of individuals or groups
	to ‘return to normality’ after environmental, social, and/or economic shocks. Given the chronic adversity and
	systematic oppression faced by Indigenous communities in the United States, how can we make sense of the idea of a
	return to normal when it is not a return to their normal? The Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe (NCRNT), an
	unrecognized Indigenous nation in Northern California, face ongoing challenges to its sovereign status within federal
	borders, and by proxy, to its survival. A key challenge to NCRNT resilience stems from the Tribe’s historic erasure
	caused by genocide, as well illegal termination and dispossession of its land bases and political influence vis-à-vis
	local, state and federal government agencies. Because of this history, the NCRNT has defined its previous resilience
	strategy as mere ‘survival,’ reflecting the Tribe’s internal efforts to protect its culture and people throughout the
	latter half of the twentieth century. In cases such as this then, how can unrecognized Indigenous nations forge forms
	of resilience that are reflective of their normal? One vector for this possibility is through the production of
	information about their past and present that is visible to a world of policymakers, which serves to highlight the
	value and significance of Indigenous histories on both the domestic and global stage. Within the last fifteen years
	the NCRNT have undertaken efforts to increase its visibility that have produced critical pathways towards increased
	autonomy, agency and ultimately resilience. Using recent oral histories, artwork, and documentation from the newly
	created NCRN Tribal archive, this paper explores the history of the tribe and the ways in which their mode of
	resilience has transformed in the twenty first century from a strategy survival to a conscious pursuit of visibility.
	By engaging with Indigenous histories and experiences, this article challenges the underlying assumption of normality
	within international development concepts of resilience and associated practice. Rather than a return to a presumed
	normal, the NCRNT’s visibility efforts in the twenty-first century reframe the concept of resilience to link the
	political past, present and future together in rhetoric and action to meet the Tribe’s needs. The NCRNT’s experience
	reveals how activities underlying Indigenous resilience represent a need for historical redress and reconciliation,
	thereby creating a ‘new normal’ that is reflective of Native history as well as the ongoing social, political, and
	economic realities of existing within a settler state. This exploration of resilience expands the dialectical
	possibilities of history and development studies and provides historical purchase to ongoing efforts of Indigenous
	groups seeking restorative justice. This work is presented as an interactive digital article using hyperlinked

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Resilience has been conceptualized within international development studies as the ability of individuals or groups
	to ‘return to normality’ after environmental, social, and/or economic shocks.
	<a href="#_ftn1" title="" name="_ftnref1"> [1] </a> Given the chronic adversity and systematic oppression faced by
	Indigenous communities in the United States, how can we make sense of the idea of a return to normal when it is not a
	return to their normal? The Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe (NCRNT), an unrecognized Indigenous nation in Northern
	California, face ongoing challenges to its sovereign status within federal borders, and by proxy, to its survival. A
	key challenge to NCRNT resilience stems from the Tribe’s historic erasure caused by genocide, as well illegal
	termination and dispossession of its land bases and political influence vis-à-vis local, state, and federal government
	agencies. Because of this history, the NCRNT has defined its previous resilience strategy as mere ‘survival,’
	reflecting its internal efforts to protect NCRNT culture and people throughout the latter half of the twentieth
	century. In cases such as this then, how can unrecognized Indigenous nations forge forms of resilience that are
	reflective of their normal? One vector for this possibility is through the production of information about their past
	and present that is visible to a world of policymakers, which serves to highlight the value and significance of
	Indigenous histories on both the domestic and global stage. Within the last fifteen years the NCRNT have undertaken
	efforts to increase its visibility that have produced critical pathways towards increased autonomy, agency and
	ultimately resilience. In effect, the NCRNT has transformed its resilience strategy in the twenty-first century from a
	strategy of survival to a conscious pursuit of visibility that frames restorative justice as a necessary feature of
	effective resilience.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The NCRNT’s contemporary approach to resilience was made clear on December 18, 2022, when members of the Tribe
	gathered with non-Native community members for a workshop focused on identifying the ‘key driving factors for peace,
	conflicts, climate vulnerabilities, and resilience’ in Nevada County, California. The workshop was hosted by
	<a href="https://www.cdacollaborative.org/">CDA Collaborative Learning</a>, an international development organization
	that conducts participatory research dedicated to improving the effectiveness of global peacebuilding, development and
	humanitarian efforts.
	<a href="#_ftn2" title="" name="_ftnref2"> [2] </a> As part of CDA’s global project on the ‘
	<a href="https://www.cdacollaborative.org/cdaproject/environment-fragility-peace">Environment-Fragility-Peace
		Nexus</a>,’ the workshop aimed to develop lessons on Indigenous resilience strategies to inform policy and practice
	within international development.
	<a href="#_ftn3" title="" name="_ftnref3"> [3] </a> CDA sought out the NCRNT for collaboration due to the Tribe’s
	position as an Indigenous group operating in a region of the United States that experiences recurring environmental
	disasters. Specifically, California’s history of fire suppression policies beginning in the 1800s have created a
	modern wildfire crisis.
	<a href="#_ftn4" title="" name="_ftnref4"> [4] </a> As of 2023, approximately fifty percent of the Nevada County
	population live in areas labeled as very high wildfire-risk.’
	<a href="#_ftn5" title="" name="_ftnref5"> [5] </a> Catastrophic megafires have become a year-round threat, and the
	state’s most destructive and deadliest fires have all occurred in the last decade.
	<a href="#_ftn6" title="" name="_ftnref6"> [6] </a> In addition to wildfires, the region experiences high levels of
	environmental toxicity due to the history of hydraulic gold mining from 1848 to the 1940s when Nevada County was one
	of the most productive gold mining regions in the country.
	<a href="#_ftn7" title="" name="_ftnref7"> [7] </a>
</p>
<p>Organizations like CDA have grown increasingly interested in collaborating with Indigenous groups to inform normative
	resilience practice against such environmental risks.
	<a href="#_ftn8" title="" name="_ftnref8"> [8] </a> Indigenous groups represent one of the most vulnerable populations
	impacted by conflict and climate change.
	<a href="#_ftn9" title="" name="_ftnref9"> [9] </a> They are also the primary population associated with adaptive
	environmental strategies that have proven effective in preventing and responding to environmental vulnerabilities
	historically.
	<a href="#_ftn10" title="" name="_ftnref10"> [10] </a> The NCRNT are therefore approached frequently by state,
	federal, non-profit and private actors to inform practical strategies that facilitate resilience against environmental
	risks such as wildfires and environmental toxicity {% view_video NCRNT-council-elders-in conversation-with-tribal-spokesperson-shelly-covert %}. Requests tend to focus on the Tribe’s history of employing
	traditional burns to reduce the scale and intensity of wildfires and sustainably manage local ecological systems. This
	relationship between Indigenous vulnerability, traditional ecological knowledge and climate change resilience informed
	CDA’s interest in approaching the NCRNT for research collaboration in 2022. Through the research, CDA hoped to
	identify how traditional ecological knowledge could be employed for conflict and climate change resilience for
	communities that face similar challenges as the NCRNT. Yet, as is often the case with participatory research, the
	discussions at CDA’s workshop produced a nuanced concept of resilience that moved beyond development ideas of easily
	transferable practices related to wildfires or environmental toxicity. By the end of the workshop, members of the
	NCRNT, non-Native community members, and CDA researchers agreed on the following conclusion:
</p>
<p>“Contemporary climate vulnerabilities experienced in California are directly tied to the state’s history of genocide
	against Indigenous people. Adapting to and building resilience against these vulnerabilities thereby necessitates
	addressing historical injustices that cause these vulnerabilities.”
	<a href="#_ftn11" title="" name="_ftnref11"> [11] </a>
</p>
<p>The workshop produced a historically centered concept of resilience that linked political and environmental
	vulnerabilities together, and posited restorative justice as a necessary feature of effective resilience. {% view_video CDA_workshop_factors_for_resilience %} This
	conceptual re-framing of resilience marks a significant departure from normative apolitical and ahistorical concepts
	within the development field. Development discourse has traditionally prioritized the concept of resilience as a
	‘return to normal’ and neglected the role of self-determination both in identifying how and why Indigenous groups are
	resilient, to what they are resilient against, and what the ‘end goal’ of such resilience might be. What is missing
	from these concepts is the fact that Indigenous experiences and definitions of resilience are inherently tied to
	issues of ‘power, knowledge, justice and self-determination.’
	<a href="#_ftn12" title="" name="_ftnref12"> [12] </a> In exploring the NCRNT’s participation in various visibility
	efforts such as the development of a support non-profit; the creation of a Tribal archive; and various research
	collaborations such as CDA’s workshop, this digital article highlights the necessity of reframing international
	development theory and practice on resilience to address historical oppression and trauma.
</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Part I: “Indigenous resilience” in International Development</h1>
<p>Originating in the field of ecology during the 1960s and 1970s,
	<a href="#_ftn13" title="" name="_ftnref13"> [13] </a> the concept of resilience refers to “the time required for a
	system to return to an equilibrium or steady-state following a perturbation.”
	<a href="#_ftn14" title="" name="_ftnref14"> [14] </a> Central to this definition is the assumption that natural
	systems operate in a state of equilibrium, which they can return to following extreme events given the right
	conditions. This underlying logic of resilience as a ‘return to normal’ transferred into social discourse through the
	adoption of the concept within development studies. In the 1980s, the concept of resilience expanded beyond its
	origins in ecology into social systems. Researchers began examining how social groups adapt to stresses and rapid
	changes, and eventually linked social resilience to sustainable development and reducing the vulnerability of
	communities. By the 1990s and early 2000s, the field of development studies adopted resilience thinking, applying it
	to issues of poverty, disasters, climate change, and conflict.
	<a href="#_ftn15" title="" name="_ftnref15"> [15] </a> Resilience moved from a descriptive concept to being seen as a
	normative goal for development programs, with the aim of building capacities to help communities better absorb shocks
	and shorten ‘recovery’ times. Today, the United Nations defines resilience as “the ability of a system, community or
	society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform and recover from the effects of a
	hazard in a timely and efficient manner.”
	<a href="#_ftn16" title="" name="_ftnref16"> [16] </a> Development concepts of resilience thus reflect their roots in
	ecology by focusing on the ability of communities to ‘bounce back’ after crises.
</p>
<p>The emphasis of returning to normality within development definitions of resilience takes a short-term view that
	obscures the impacts of complex histories of injustice and subjugation against communities such as the NCRNT.
	<a href="#_ftn17" title="" name="_ftnref17"> [17] </a> Following two centuries of genocidal policies and ongoing
	structural constraints to their sovereign rights, the NCRNT has only 66 enrolled members remaining today, 87 percent
	of whom live at or below the poverty line.
	<a href="#_ftn18" title="" name="_ftnref18"> [18] </a> In the context of fundamentally altered cultural, political,
	economic, and environmental realities, the NCRNT therefore have no ‘normal’ from which to return. {% view_video NCRNT_Elder_Virginia_Covert %} The experience of
	the NCRNT reflects a broader critique amongst scholars who have argued that international development concepts of
	resilience represent forms of contemporary violence and colonialism by neglecting such histories of oppression.
	<a href="#_ftn19" title="" name="_ftnref19"> [19] </a> A prominent critique in this regard is Mark Pelling and David
	Manuel-Navarrete’s argument that resilience approaches ignore root causes of inequality by focusing on returning
	societies to an ‘imagined stable state.’
	<a href="#_ftn20" title="" name="_ftnref20"> [20] </a> They argue that resilience analysis focuses on system
	preservation and restoration, neglecting issues of power, politics and justice. This treats social change as
	pathological rather than organic and suggests disaster responses should aim to return to the pre-disaster status quo.
	Pelling and Manuel-Navarrete further contend that resilience discourse makes vulnerable communities responsible for
	their own security without addressing root causes or transforming underlying conditions. By retaining a focus on
	stabilizing pre-existing social and ecological conditions, this approach effectively neglects chronic vulnerabilities,
	thereby sustaining an unjust “normality” for marginalized groups.
	<a href="#_ftn21" title="" name="_ftnref21"> [21] </a> Robin May Schott leverages a similar critique of the
	ahistorical and apolitical nature of resilience. Schott argues that resilience frameworks promote a future orientation
	that obscures past harms, unfinished political struggles, and the root causes of chronic vulnerabilities. By treating
	vulnerability as an abstract condition to be overcome through adaptability, resilience ignores how systemic oppression
	and historical violence produce the very conditions of such vulnerabilities. By disconnecting vulnerability from
	specific contested political relations and material conditions, resilience also decontextualizes and depoliticizes
	injury and suffering.
	<a href="#_ftn22" title="" name="_ftnref22"> [22] </a>
</p>
<p>These debates intersect with wider discussions on the politics of recognition and refusal regarding how societies
	validate identities and what implications this has on social justice, colonialism, and Indigenous sovereignty.
	<a href="#_ftn23" title="" name="_ftnref23"> [23] </a> The politics of recognition, as theorized by scholars like
	Charles Taylor and Nancy Fraser, refers to the practice whereby marginalized or disenfranchised groups seek
	acknowledgment and validation from dominant power structures.
	<a href="#_ftn24" title="" name="_ftnref24"> [24] </a> In the context of Indigenous rights, this involves seeking
	recognition of Indigenous identities, cultures, and rights from the state.
	<a href="#_ftn25" title="" name="_ftnref25"> [25] </a> Recognition can occur through such processes as treaty-making,
	acknowledgement of land rights, protection of cultural practices, or the establishment of political autonomy, for
	example through federal recognition in the United States.
	<a href="#_ftn26" title="" name="_ftnref26"> [26] </a> Recognition can provide material benefits and protections to
	Indigenous communities and implies a demand for justice, a call for the restoration of rights that were usurped, and
	an assertion of the Indigenous people's distinct identities and values.
	<a href="#_ftn27" title="" name="_ftnref27"> [27] </a>
</p>
<p>However, critics of recognition like Elizabeth Povinelli, Heidi Sinevaara-Niskanen and Marjo Lindroth note that
	recognition often comes with conditions set by the settler state, which can limit Indigenous sovereignty and
	perpetuate colonial control.
	<a href="#_ftn28" title="" name="_ftnref28"> [28] </a>  Recognition is a complex process with inherent challenges. It
	often requires Indigenous communities to align with the norms and definitions set by the colonizing state or dominant
	society to be acknowledged, which might involve compromising their own customs, values, or systems of self-governance.
	Thus, recognition can potentially become a form of control or assimilation, perpetuating the power dynamics of
	colonization. The politics of refusal, on the other hand, represents a rejection of the state's authority to define
	and recognize Indigenous identity and rights. This approach, as articulated by scholars like Audra Simpson and Glen
	Coulthard, asserts that Indigenous sovereignty exists inherently and independently of state recognition.
	<a href="#_ftn29" title="" name="_ftnref29"> [29] </a> Rather than seeking validation or acceptance from colonial
	structures, Indigenous communities assert their autonomy by choosing how, when, and by whom they are recognized.
	Coulthard argues for a form of Indigenous self-determination that rejects the politics of recognition in favor of
	refusal, asserting that Indigenous rights and identities exist inherently, regardless of whether they are recognized
	by the state.
	<a href="#_ftn30" title="" name="_ftnref30"> [30] </a> Similarly, Simpson posits that the act of refusal can serve as
	a potent form of resistance against colonial domination.
	<a href="#_ftn31" title="" name="_ftnref31"> [31] </a> Refusal is therefore predicated on rejecting state procedures
	or making Indigenous struggle legible to settler law and discourse.
</p>
<p>While the politics of refusal offers an enticing politically conscious alternative to the colonial politics of
	recognition, refusal is not always a feasible option. For large Indigenous nations such as the Mohawk, the politics of
	refusal provides a genuine opportunity to construct recognition and autonomy, and therefore resilience, beyond the
	settler state.
	<a href="#_ftn32" title="" name="_ftnref32"> [32] </a> Yet, in the case of structurally marginalized, small,
	geographically displaced unrecognized nations like the NCRNT, the politics of refusal may result in the sacrifice of
	resources and tools that are essential to their resilience and to holding the settler state accountable.
	<a href="#_ftn33" title="" name="_ftnref33"> [33] </a> Bruce Granville Miller notes how nonrecognition leads to the
	marginalization of Indigenous groups, as they are denied access to rights and resources that come with state
	recognition.
	<a href="#_ftn34" title="" name="_ftnref34"> [34] </a> They are also often excluded from discussions and decisions
	about their ancestral lands and resources. Nonrecognition thereby contributes to the ongoing dispossession and
	displacement Indigenous groups, and as such, recognition and visibility may represent a vital resource for resilience.
	The NCRNT has little choice but to engage with the settler systems to ensure their own survival. As such, we must look
	beyond theory on the politics of refusal and recognition to better understand the lived-reality and implications of
	the resilience of small unrecognized nations. Groups like the NCRNT often employ a combination of both the politics of
	recognition and refusal, seeking state resources and legitimacy without being wholly legible to state power.
	<a href="#_ftn35" title="" name="_ftnref35"> [35] </a> Recognition politics can therefore remain strategically useful
	for marginalized groups.

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Part II: Resilience of The Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Century </h1>
<p>As of 2023, the Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe is a federally unrecognized tribe based in Nevada City,
	California - a small well-known ‘gold rush town’ on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains. {% view_image western-slope-of-the-sierra-nevada-mountains.png %} The NCRNT has
	lived in Nevada County since time immemorial and represent one of the political and governmental units within the
	larger Nisenan Nation. Within the wider Nisenan-speaking whole, members of the NCRNT represent three different and
	unique dialects of language and distinct territories directly attached to their political and governmental leadership.
	Prior to the California gold rush, anthropologists and Nisenan Elders say that several thousands of Nisenan occupied
	the region of California connecting the Sacramento River, the Consumnes River, the crest of the Sierra Nevada
	mountains, and the North Fork of the ‘Uba (Yuba) River from the Sierra Crest to the Sacramento Valley.
	<a href="#_ftn37" title="" name="_ftnref37"> [37] </a> The NCRNT represent one of the most vulnerable populations to
	social and environmental risks in Nevada County. They are one of several remaining tribes in California to have
	federal services terminated under the 1958 California Rancheria Termination Act and have not seen their federal
	recognition restored, leaving them without a land base or political sovereignty vis-a-vis the United States.
	Importantly, denial of federal recognition deprives tribes of freedom of religious practice, repatriation of cultural
	artifacts, federal health, housing, education and job assistance programs, thus representing an ongoing form of
	institutional erasure.
	<a href="#_ftn38" title="" name="_ftnref38"> [38] </a> In many cases denial of these forms of support has kept
	Indigenous populations in cycles of poverty and scarcity, perpetrating a form of long-term ‘slow’ violence against
	groups.
	<a href="#_ftn39" title="" name="_ftnref39"> [39] </a> Tribal members have also been directly affected by wildfires,
	including the direct loss of housing and property and the experience of annual displacement due to wildfire
	evacuations. The current status of the NCRNT thereby reflects a long history of Indigenous oppression, dispossession
	and disenfranchisement by the U.S. government.
</p>
<p>Tribes in California such as the NCRNT have faced a particular history of complex institutionalized violence stemming
	first from the era of Spanish missionization and then from the policies and practices of the Mexican and American
	governments. At the start of the California gold rush in 1848 and into the early twentieth century, U.S. Federal
	Indian policy prioritized assimilation via the forced removal of Indigenous people, concentration camps and violence,
	including murder, and destruction of culture, food sources and livelihoods. The 1850 California Act for the Government
	and Protection of Indians established the organized stealing of Native children from their families and the placement
	of them in white custody, effectively creating a generation of Native Nations removed from their traditional lands,
	languages, and cultures.
	<a href="#_ftn40" title="" name="_ftnref40"> [40] </a> In 1851 California’s first Governor stated that: “a war of
	extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct . . . ,” and, by 1863,
	fueled by the increasing demand of whites for land and resources, the killing of Indigenous people in California was
	directly sanctioned by the state and promoted via financial incentives.
	<a href="#_ftn41" title="" name="_ftnref41"> [41] </a> Policies included the funding of state sponsored “scalp
	bounties,” whereby private citizens were provided five dollars for every Indian scalp delivered.
	<a href="#_ftn42" title="" name="_ftnref42"> [42] </a> By 1870, the Native population in California had been reduced
	to around 30,000 people, less than twenty percent of the population assumed to have existed in 1846.
	<a href="#_ftn43" title="" name="_ftnref43"> [43] </a> Alongside many other tribes, the Nisenan also faced
	particularly gendered forms of violence. Nisenan men were specifically targeted and killed to enable the rape and
	enslavement of Nisenan women, and children were forcibly removed, thus interfering with the reproductive future of the
	Tribe.
	<a href="#_ftn44" title="" name="_ftnref44"> [44] </a> Throughout this period, the NCRNT faced extreme population loss
	– by 1867, only eighteen years after the start of the gold rush, the Tribe had been reduced by roughly ninety-three
	percent.
	<a href="#_ftn45" title="" name="_ftnref45"> [45] </a>
</p>
<p>Other policies aimed at extermination and assimilation focused on the social, cultural, economic, and political
	disenfranchisement of Native Americans. The reservation system was used by the U.S. government in California to remove
	Native groups and open land for maximum settlement during the gold rush.
	<a href="#_ftn46" title="" name="_ftnref46"> [46] </a> Explicit reservation policies included the
	government-sanctioned spread of Christianity; the replacement of communal economies with private property
	institutions; the enforcement of English-only western pedagogy via boarding schools; the control and restriction of
	Indigenous cultural and religious practices; the granting of US citizenship; and the implementation of US-government
	managed tribal ‘self-governance.’
	<a href="#_ftn47" title="" name="_ftnref47"> [47] </a> Particularly damaging to the resilience and continuity of the
	NCRNT over time, in 1951, federal agents forcibly removed many of the NCRNT children, taking them to boarding schools
	and/or placing them in non-Indian foster homes {% view_image NCRNT-children-in-boarding-schools.png %}.
	<a href="#_ftn48" title="" name="_ftnref48"> [48] </a> Richard Johnson, the current Chairman of the NCRNT, was removed
	and forced into foster care at age two. {% view_image chairman-of-NCRNT-richard-johnson.png %}
</p>
<p>Wildfire suppression policies were damaging to both Indigenous cultural survival and the natural environment. At the
	start of the gold rush, the U.S. government outlawed native burning practices, in part to preserve grasslands for
	settler livestock grazing.
	<a href="#_ftn49" title="" name="_ftnref49"> [49] </a> Fire is integral to Nisenan society and ecology in multiple
	ways. As a cremation society, they conduct elaborate funeral rituals called ‘cries’ where the deceased and their
	possessions are burned on pyres, allowing their spirits to enter the afterlife and ascend to the milky way via the
	Nisenan sacred mountain, ‘Estom Yanim.
	<a href="#_ftn50" title="" name="_ftnref50"> [50] </a> Prior to the gold rush, the Nisenan also utilized fire to care
	for the land. Burning helped limit destructive wildfires by reducing fuel loads, controlled harmful insect populations
	impacting food sources, and enriched soils to improve future grass harvests.
	<a href="#_ftn51" title="" name="_ftnref51"> [51] </a> Fire suppression thereby enacted colonial violence by
	disrupting Nisenan land caretaking, severing spiritual relationships to fire, and prohibiting open-air funeral pyres.
	Today, forests in the Sierra Nevada are highly homogenous, dominated by fire-intolerant species and overly dense with
	small trees and shrubs that are prone to high-intensity fire.
	<a href="#_ftn52" title="" name="_ftnref52"> [52] </a> Requests from U.S. government agencies to support with
	reintroducing traditional burning practices in California therefore land with a sting of historical irony and erasure
	for the NCRNT. While the NCRNT has remained resilient to environmental shocks historically, European colonization and
	the banning of Native cultural practices including traditional wildfire prevention created many of the ongoing
	conditions of vulnerability that demand resilience today. In other words, after over 150 years of attempted erasure of
	Indigenous groups and culture in California, the same groups that were once targets are now sought for their support
	in tackling the consequences of the very actions that disposed them in the first place. Worse yet, while U.S.
	government agencies often request information and knowledge about traditional practices from Indigenous groups, the
	federal government refuses to acknowledge the political legitimacy of the NCRNT through federal recognition.
	<a href="#_ftn53" title="" name="_ftnref53"> [53] </a> This neglect for the political reality of Indigenous groups
	leaves those like the NCRNT in an impossible, one-sided relationship whereby the U.S. government celebrates and
	extracts traditional knowledge yet ignores and undermines sources of Indigenous self-determination that offer
	significant support for resilience.  
</p>
<p>Relative to other states, tribes in California face particular structural challenges to their attempts at gaining
	federal recognition due to the state’s history of undermining institutional recognition for Native Americans. In 1851
	Nisenan Chief Weimar signed the Camp Union Treaty, which the U.S. Senate rejected along with all other California
	treaties at the urging of the California congressional delegation in 1852 {% view_image nisenan-chief-weimar-and-california-congressional-delegation.png %}. Treaties would later become an essential
	component of tribal recognition applications and land reclamation requests in the twentieth and twenty-first century.
	<a href="#_ftn54" title="" name="_ftnref54"> [54] </a> Legal interpretations for claims are dependent on the United
	States ratifying treaties, thus establishing a historic record of a government-to-government relationship with tribes.
	In the absence of ratified treaties, many tribes in California are viewed as non-existent in the eyes of the federal
	government today.
	<a href="#_ftn55" title="" name="_ftnref55"> [55] </a> Yet for seventy-three years, the U.S. federal government did in
	fact recognize the political sovereignty of the NCRNT. In 1891, a member of the Tribe successfully applied for a land
	allotment through an amendment to the Dawes Severalty Act. Referred to at the time as the ‘Nevada or Colony Tribe of
	Indians,’ members of the Tribe thus received their first legally protected plot of land under U.S. law. In 1913,
	following a series of repeated competing land claims to the allotment, President Woodrow Wilson established the
	allotment as an executive order reservation. {% view_image president-woodrow-wilson-executive-order.png %} Referred to in the executive order as the ‘Nevada or Colony Tribe of
	Indians,’ members of the Tribe thus received their first legally protected plot of land under U.S. law {% view_image tribe-first-legally-protected-plot-of-land.png %}. The status of
	the Tribe was reinforced again in 1934, when Tribal members voted to organize under the Indian Reorganization Act
	(IRA).
	<a href="#_ftn56" title="" name="_ftnref56"> [56] </a> And in 1947, the Tribe was listed in the Haas Report, which
	reported on the federally acknowledged tribes organized by the IRA.
	<a href="#_ftn57" title="" name="_ftnref57"> [57] </a>
</p>
<p>In the 1930s, driven by a report of the dire conditions of reservations and Native welfare that challenged emerging
	U.S. liberal ideals of economic opportunity, federal Indian policy shifted towards a preference for Tribal sovereignty
	over assimilation.
	<a href="#_ftn58" title="" name="_ftnref58"> [58] </a> The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act (IRA/Indian New Deal),
	reorganized tribes as corporate entities in hopes of enabling economic development and Native self-government.
	<a href="#_ftn59" title="" name="_ftnref59"> [59] </a> While the ideals and many of the outcomes of the IRA were
	supportive of Tribal self-determination, the IRA also led to diverse and sometimes problematic outcomes for tribes.
	One such outcome included the codifying of tribal identities in line with Western notions of identity that bifurcated
	Tribal relationships with land and encouraged isolation from neighboring tribes that had historically shared their
	ancestry and culture.
	<a href="#_ftn60" title="" name="_ftnref60"> [60] </a> In the case of the NCRNT, the Nevada City Nisenan identity was
	legally separated from other Nisenan groups in the region, thus placing strict requirements on who could be considered
	a Nevada City Nisenan. The Tribe’s participation in the IRA codified this bifurcation. Counterintuitively, the U.S.
	government neglected the bifurcation of Tribal identity and land in 1958 when Congress voted terminate the Nevada City
	Rancheria. In a series of policies referred to as ‘termination’ throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. federal
	government sold reservation lands and severed the sovereignty of tribes by formally cancelling their federal
	recognition status.
	<a href="#_ftn61" title="" name="_ftnref61"> [61] </a> In 1958, Congress named the Nevada City Rancheria in the
	California Rancheria Act, under which two members of the Tribe’s 22 adult members voted in favor of a distribution
	plan to sell the 75-acre rancheria {% view_image distribution-of-the-land-and-assets.png %}. As a result, on September 21, 1964 the Nevada City Rancheria land was sold by the
	federal government via auction to non-Native individuals and the federal trust relationship with the Tribe was
	terminated. {% view_image termination-of-federal-supervision-article.png %}
	<a href="#_ftn62" title="" name="_ftnref62"> [62] </a> Today, the NCRNT is treated as an unrecognized tribe by the
	United States and enjoys no legal right to Tribal land or political sovereignty.
	<a href="#_ftn63" title="" name="_ftnref63"> [63] </a> The Tribe has been seeking the restoration of their sovereign
	status, through both formal and informal means, ever since.
</p>
<p>It is unsurprising then that when asked how they would have defined their resilience strategy in the twentieth
	century, Tribal members provided a response reflective of the complete destruction of their social, political, and
	cultural fabric. Amid ongoing direct and structural violence, Tribe members had no choice but to hide from the
	dominant society, afraid that speaking their language, conducting traditional practices, or even being identified as
	Indian would result in punishment such as kidnapping or death. [Saxon video 02 – 5:04] And following the complete loss
	of their land rights and political sovereignty via termination, Tribal members were left geographically dispersed,
	economically and political disenfranchised, and culturally damaged. For the NCRNT, the concept of resilience during
	such a period could only be defined as ‘survival.’ </p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Part III: Seeking a ‘New Normal’ as Resilience in the Twenty-First Century</h1>
<p>Despite its historical trajectory, the NCRNT has shown remarkable resilience throughout the twentieth and
	twenty-first century. By the time of the Tribe’s termination in 1964, their enrolled members stood at only seventeen
	individuals. Today, the NCRNT has grown to 66 enrolled members and the Tribe has managed to begin successfully
	rebuilding many of the political and cultural institutions that they saw damaged through colonization.
	<a href="#_ftn64" title="" name="_ftnref64"> [64] </a> They have also remained politically active in seeking the
	restoration of their federally recognized status. In the 1970s, the Tribe was a plaintiff in <em>Tillie Hardwick v.
		U.S.</em> (1979), in which the United States entered into a stipulated judgment that restored federal recognition to
	Tribes in California that has been wrongly terminated in the 1958 California Rancheria Act.
	<a href="#_ftn65" title="" name="_ftnref65"> [65] </a> However, the United States omitted the Tribe from the
	stipulated judgment due to a ‘clerical error.’
	<a href="#_ftn66" title="" name="_ftnref66"> [66] </a> The NCRNT then sued the U.S. government in 2010 to correct the
	<em>Hardwick</em> judgment, but the United States claimed the case had passed the statute of limitations.
	<a href="#_ftn67" title="" name="_ftnref67"> [67] </a> As a result of these judgments, the NCRNT remain landless and
	without U.S. recognized political sovereignty, which has led to the Tribe seeking both formal recognition and informal
	recognition via their ongoing visibility activities.
</p>
<p>Today, the NCRNT define their resilience as “the ability to restore, protect and perpetuate Nisenan culture,”
	emphasizing the safeguarding and transmission of their culture to future generations, the preservation of tribal
	members' physical well-being, restoration and protection of the natural environment, and the cultivation of historical
	reconciliation with the non-Native community.
	<a href="#_ftn68" title="" name="_ftnref68"> [68] </a> [Sarah and Shelly video 04 – 2:09 – 4:37; Ginger 5:53; …]  The
	NCRNT view the restoration of federal recognition as crucial to achieving these objectives. But meeting the
	prerequisites for federal recognition and acquiring the necessary financial, human, and political resources creates
	tensions with Indigenous sovereignty in the interim. Faced with a choice of allocating vital financial and human
	resources toward federal recognition efforts versus allocating resources to self-recognition activities like language
	revitalization, curriculum development, and sustaining livelihoods, the NCRNT operate “in both worlds.”
	<a href="#_ftn69" title="" name="_ftnref69"> [69] </a> While they continue to strive for the restoration of their
	federal recognition status, the NCRNT has successfully cultivated resilience through the advancement of
	self-determination in its absence.  As a small unrecognized nation, NCRNT self-determination is predicated on a
	two-pronged approach: 1) raising visibility of their culture and knowledge within and amongst the Tribe itself; and 2)
	raising visibility of their continued existence and of the value and significance of their history amongst settler
	communities and policymakers, locally, nationally, and abroad. Resilience for NCRNT is thus driven by a fusion of both
	the politics of recognition and refusal. Here, we present three examples of NCRNT visibility efforts that have served
	to underpin the Tribe’s resilience and transform their political reality both within and beyond the purview of formal
	U.S. state systems.
</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>a.  Employing a Non-Profit in Lieu of Legal Recognition </h2>
<p>In 2014, the NCRNT established the
	<a href="https://chirpca.org/">California Heritage: Indigenous Research Project</a> (CHIRP), a 501(c)(3) non-profit
	guided by the Nevada City Rancheria Tribal Council. The goal of CHIRP is to “research, document and preserve the
	history and culture of the Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe.”
	<a href="#_ftn70" title="" name="_ftnref70"> [70] </a> As a small, unrecognized Indigenous nation, the NCRNT face
	significant challenges in forging legitimacy as within a settler state. The termination of their federal recognition
	in 1964 not only severed their federal trust relationship, but also severed opportunities for the Tribe to engage with
	legal structures for rights claims. The absence of federal recognition also created symbolic illegitimacy for the
	Tribe. A significant challenge for NCRNT resilience has therefore existed around raising visibility of the Tribe’s
	continued existence to reestablish this legitimacy. By creating CHIRP, the NCRNT created a formal, public-facing legal
	entity that is able to “creatively mimic” the symbolic, material and political benefits of federal recognition.
	<a href="#_ftn71" title="" name="_ftnref71"> [71] </a>
</p>
<p>The benefits of CHIRP have been numerous. CHIRP activities have led to the revitalization of the Nisenan language,
	the development of academic curriculums for local schools, the development of a successful ongoing funding source (the
	<a href="https://chirpca.org/ancestral-homelands">Ancestral Homelands Reciprocity Program</a>), and the ability of the
	Tribe to partner with other institutions for land management and land return efforts. A significant part of this
	success has come from CHIRP’s creation of a free public museum
	<a href="https://www.ubaseo.org/">‘Uba Seo</a> and its corresponding annual
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEWEoCim6UQ">Visibility Through Art</a> (VTA) program, which has functioned
	as a primary source of local visibility and political legitimacy for the NCRNT.  Visibility Through Art was inspired
	by the Tribe’s desire to collaborate with local artists to create artwork that represents and highlights the Nisenan
	and their “rich but nearly forgotten history here in Nevada County.”
	<a href="#_ftn72" title="" name="_ftnref72"> [72] </a> Through the program, non-Native artists are “asked to engage in
	deep listening to the stories and history shared with them by the Tribal members, Tribal Council and Nisenan Elders.”
	<a href="#_ftn73" title="" name="_ftnref73"> [73] </a> Following Tribal consultation, artists then collaborate
	individually with Tribal members on art pieces to create reflective, historically and politically engaged works that
	are then displayed for the public at ‘Uba Seo. Because many of the collaborating artists are non-Nisenan, the program
	requires a continuous navigation of the sensitive and highly political topics of cultural appropriation, privilege,
	and erasure. This political and historical engagement with the non-Native community is where the success of ‘Uba Seo
	and VTA lies. By bringing Native and non-Native community members together to reflect on the NCRNT’s past, present and
	future through art, ‘Uba Seo and VTA enable the broader community to engage with Nisenan history and ultimately
	“reflect on the future, navigating a collective conversation.”
	<a href="#_ftn74" title="" name="_ftnref74"> [74] </a>  
</p>
<p>Moreover, VTA exhibits are not just freely available to residents and visitors of Nevada City. By creating virtual
	tours of exhibits, the Tribe has also made the legitimization of its history accessible and visible to global
	communities. The significance of this visibility approach should not be underestimated – it is highly unusual for
	groups as small and under resourced as the NCRNT to develop such strong levels of visibility in the absence of
	resources and privileges afforded through federal recognition.<sup>
		<a href="#_ftn75" title="" name="_ftnref75"> [75] </a></sup>  From 2021 to 2022, the ‘
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05uVI7oB0Xo">Erased</a>’ exhibit focused on the Tribe’s history of
	legislative and legal erasure. Erased constituted the first time that the Nisenan perspective on local history had
	been publicly reviewed and discussed in Nevada City. The exhibit featured six physical sections in the gallery, each
	highlighting different aspects of Nisenan history, culture, and erasure, thus highlighting anti-Indian legislation,
	the negation of Tribal sovereignty, and the lasting impacts of forced assimilation that continue to affect the Tribe.
	<a href="#_ftn76" title="" name="_ftnref76"> [76] </a> In 2023, the
	<a href="https://www.ubaseo.org/hamukum">‘hamukum</a> exhibit – Nisenan for “. . .they said long ago. . .” – counters
	settler narratives of the NCRNT using art, imagery, historic photographs, documents and interactive elements. The
	exhibit explores pivotal moments in history from the Nisenan perspective whilst also presenting narratives of a
	‘future history’ whereby NCRNT rights and sovereignty are protected and affirmed.
	<a href="#_ftn77" title="" name="_ftnref77"> [77] </a>
</p>
<p>Importantly for the NCRNT, the benefits of such visibility extend beyond community awareness of Nisenan history and
	support for the Tribe’s ongoing work – VTA has also supported the development of relationships between the NCRNT and
	local government actors, which have been essential to the growth of NCRNT political agency.<sup> </sup>
	<a href="#_ftn78" title="" name="_ftnref78"> [78] </a> [Saxon video 6:51] In 2022, the neighboring city of Grass
	Valley in Nevada County adopted a resolution codifying their support for the restoration of the Tribe’s federal
	recognition. In the same year, Nevada City created a permanent position of City Liaison to the Tribal Council,
	representing the first government-to-government relationship between the Tribe and the city since its founding over
	175 years ago. Importantly, the liaison role was developed to provide essential inclusion and capacity support for the
	Tribe, thus directly addressing some of the chronic vulnerabilities that preclude their engagement in local
	governance.
	<a href="#_ftn79" title="" name="_ftnref79"> [79] </a> NCRNT Spokesperson Shelly Covert commented on the significance
	of this step:
</p>
<p>“If we were Federally Recognized, the Tribe would have a space in governing within our homelands. But because we
	remain in a terminated state, we are reliant upon the community and the partnerships we have made over the last
	fifteen plus years to ensure our perspectives and visions are heard. We still self-govern, but we do it in a void that
	is usually invisible to the outside world. Bringing this liaison position forward opens the door for some of these old
	wisdoms to step through.”
	<a href="#_ftn80" title="" name="_ftnref80"> [80] </a><sup> </sup>
</p>
<p>The enduring and growing success of CHIRP and its programs are therefore a testament to the NCRNT’s ability to
	exercise resilience strategies that engage histories of oppression to construct alternative futures rooted in shared
	healing, political accountability, and reconciliation.  [Sarah and Saxon conversation – 1:11 – 2:55] </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>b. Settler and Self Recognition through Tribal Archive Development</h2>
<p>The NCRNT is in urgent need of documenting and preserving Nisenan culture and history. The Nisenan have always
	collected and shared their knowledge through oral histories, much of which was undermined or lost through the
	California genocide, government removal of children, and the destruction of Nisenan social and cultural fabric into
	the twentieth century. As noted by Ember Amador, the Executive Assistant for CHIRP, “the archiving has been going on
	for thousands and thousands of years, and then the library got blown up.” As of 2023, there are only a handful of
	NCRNT Elders who retain memory of the Tribe’s oral history and of the events of the twentieth century. The Tribe has
	also not had a physical, centralized archive historically, though Spokesperson Shelly Covert, Tribal Chairman Richard
	Johnson and other members have been collecting materials informally throughout their lives. Materials range from oral
	histories and written documents to photographs, videos, audio recordings and physical artifacts. Yet without the
	resources required to develop a formal archive, most of these materials have remained scattered between the homes of
	Tribal members or located in institutional repositories such as the National Archives in Washington, DC, which remain
	out of reach to the Tribe. Shelly Covert highlighted the precarity of the situation, noting that “pulling our
	collective histories together” means that documents, artifacts, and other materials are collected “from under the sofa
	over here, you know, in somebody's little stack of something, historical documentation from the historical society,
	somebody's book, [and other] random things over here.” The absence of a formal archive has therefore made knowledge
	retention, access to knowledge and information, and ultimately cultural preservation difficult for the NCRNT. </p>
<p>In 2018, the NCRNT began participating in the Tribal Recognition Initiative,
	<a href="#_ftn81" title="" name="_ftnref81"> [81] </a> hosted and coordinated at the Penn Cultural Heritage Center at
	the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, with support from the Andrew W. Mellon
	Foundation’s “Just Futures Initiative.” The Initiative works with federally unrecognized tribes in their transition
	journeys to federal recognition and acknowledgement, including by supporting capacity development such as land return.
	The partnership between the Initiative and the NCRNT has focused on the development of the Tribal archive, primarily
	in support of the Tribe’s renewed petition for restoration of their federally recognized status. Through the
	Initiative, Native and non-Native volunteers and research assistants spent three years assembling all materials
	mentioning the NCRNT
	<a href="#_ftn82" title="" name="_ftnref82"> [82] </a> from the relevant National Archives in Washington, DC, and San
	Bruno, CA. Since 2019, the Tribe has also engaged in an ongoing process of assembling materials from the various
	private collections of Tribal members to ensure the archive reflects all relevant aspects of NCRNT culture and
	history. Following their acquisition, materials are digitized and catalogued to the item level according to their
	collection and repository. While the archive is still in its early stages of development, the Tribe plans to have
	materials organized and accessible within a dedicated online repository by the end of 2023.
</p>
<p>The creation of the NCRNT Tribal archive and its employment for internal cultural preservation and federal
	recognition is an example of both refusal and recognition at play within NCRNT resilience strategies. Firstly, the
	development of the archive represents a significant source of cultural preservation and ‘self-recognition’ for current
	and future generations of the NCRNT beyond the purview of the U.S. government. [Saxon and Shelly video – 8:21 – 9:02]
	By collecting, organizing, and managing access to their materials, the NCRNT can educate future generations about
	themselves on their own terms, rather than relying on settler education systems that have constructed narratives of
	shame for being ‘Indian.’ NCRNT Elder Virginia Covert recalled how in eighth grade she was taught that Indians were
	‘savages’ by a teacher of hers, who himself was part Indian. Experiences such as Virginia’s reinforce the necessity of
	tribes being in control of their own identity, culture and history, as well as how these are taught. Importantly, the
	development of the archive has also meant that materials are available for educating the public, including through the
	various exhibitions at ‘Uba Seo. The ability to preserve and share their knowledge internally and amongst the public
	not only provides a source of education on Nisenan history and culture, but it also serves as a source of external
	credibility for the Tribe on their own terms. As noted by Tribal Spokesperson Shelly Covert, the development of the
	archive and preservation of historic artifacts in many ways “makes us more real.” </p>
<p>Second, the creation of a Tribal archive enables the NCRNT to make their history and culture legible to government
	institutions, which provides the Tribe with agency in seeking forms of recognition. Gathering evidence of their
	history and culture to support their petition for federal recognition has been a primary focus of the Tribe’s archival
	development process with the Tribal Recognition Initiative. The current process for seeking federal recognition is
	incredibly onerous and requires tribes to produce significant bodies of evidence of their own existence.
	<a href="#_ftn83" title="" name="_ftnref83"> [83] </a> In the context of California history where tribes have had to
	resort to hiding to survive, recognition requirements are predictably difficult to meet, if not impossible in many
	cases. Reflecting the neoliberal tendency to place the responsibility of resilience on vulnerable populations instead
	of the state, the NCRNT is forced to gather historical materials that prove their own existence to be eligible for
	recognition by the state that erased them in the first place.
	<a href="#_ftn84" title="" name="_ftnref84"> [84] </a> As noted by Brian I. Daniels in his work on the relationship
	between tribal sovereignty and cultural preservation, “History dangles the promise of future sovereignty.”
	<a href="#_ftn85" title="" name="_ftnref85"> [85] </a> By collating both Tribal and U.S. government materials within
	their own archive, and by employing these materials for visibility across multiple realms of their own choosing, the
	NCRNT has creatively augmented traditional pathways towards recognition. In tandem with their search for U.S.
	government recognition, the NCRNT has employed its history and culture to forge forms of local, national and
	international recognition in the interim.
</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>c. Non-Native Collaboration for Strengthening Tribal Capacity</h2>
<p>The NCRNT faces particular challenges to its resilience as a result of both its size as a small tribe and the impacts
	of structural marginalization upon Tribal resources. Most NCRNT members live at or below the poverty line, which
	creates structural constraints to Tribal activities such as archive development, Tribal education, environmental
	protection and other aspects of Nisenan resilience.
	<a href="#_ftn86" title="" name="_ftnref86"> [86] </a> Without the financial resources needed to pay Tribal members
	for their time and efforts, engaging and supporting members in cultural preservation activities remains challenging.
	<a href="#_ftn87" title="" name="_ftnref87"> [87] </a> CHIRP and the Tribe’s resources remain insufficient for
	supporting the full range of activities required for federal recognition or increasing the broader visibility of the
	Tribe. Addressing these capacity deficits has therefore been a central focus for the NCRNT, which has led to multiple
	voluntary collaborative efforts between the Tribe and non-Native individuals and groups.
</p>
<p>NCRNT collaborations with non-Native individuals have been particularly effective for increasing the financial
	capacity of CHIRP and the Tribe. For example, the Tribe’s collaboration with a non-Native grant writer in New York has
	led to over $255,000 in successful grant applications for CHIRP between 2021 and 2023. And in 2023, this collaboration
	resulted in CHIRP receiving a three-year $1 million ‘Elevate Youth California’ youth substance use disorder grant,
	which focuses on educating youth around harm reduction and building peer leadership and awareness around environmental
	and social justice issues. Collaborations have also focused specifically on establishing legal and political momentum
	towards re-instating the Tribe’s federal recognition. The NCRNT collaboration with the Tribal Recognition Initiative
	involves weekly meetings with the Penn Cultural Heritage Center’s Dr. Brian I. Daniels, who provides them with advice
	tailored to their unique circumstances as a tribe subject to the California Rancheria Act. This collaboration is
	further supported by federal Indian law expert Frank Lawrence, who joins the same weekly calls to provide pro bono
	legal support. These collaborations have supplemented the Tribe’s capacity gaps and enabled them to grow CHIRP and
	seek recognition at a pace that is both manageable for the Tribe’s capacity and in line with their unique needs.</p>
<p>The NCRNT also collaborates across different societal levels to garner visibility and posit their history as a source
	of nuance for issues that affect them.
	<a href="#_ftn88" title="" name="_ftnref88"> [88] </a> In 2021, the NCRNT collaborated with Dylan Fitzwater, a
	master’s student at the University of California, Los Angeles, for his thesis research on the politics of wildfire
	prevention and Nisenan traditional burn practices. Importantly, Fitzwater’s research draws attention to the political
	realities of government agencies attempting to work with unrecognized tribes to employ traditional ecological
	knowledge.
	<a href="#_ftn89" title="" name="_ftnref89"> [89] </a> Similarly, in 2022 the NCRNT collaborated with Aleena Church, a
	master’s student at the California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, to produce an understanding of ongoing
	settler colonial violence against sacred Nisenan water resources. Church worked closely with the Tribe using archival
	research and Participatory Action Research methods to produce a shared understanding of the Tribe’s history and
	contemporary realities, which relied upon the use of Nisenan art, poetry and storytelling.
	<a href="#_ftn90" title="" name="_ftnref90"> [90] </a> And as of 2022, the NCRNT began collaborating with University
	of Cambridge doctoral candidate Megan Renoir, for her historical research on the Tribe’s institutional relationships
	vis-à-vis the U.S. government between 1891 and 1964.
	<a href="#_ftn91" title="" name="_ftnref91"> [91] </a> Renoir’s engagement with the Tribe has included ongoing support
	for their archive’s development, and research that provides the Tribe with other avenues for developing visibility.
</p>
<p>In all cases, the NCRNT research collaborations with non-Native students have provided the Tribe with additional
	capacity to facilitate the production of research that reflects the Indigenous reality as well as a settler reality,
	and that reframes damaging historical narratives to support NCRNT resilience. Because each researcher has engaged with
	the historical experiences of the NCRNT, these research collaborations have also led to the Tribe receiving continued
	support for furthering the development of their archive. </p>
<p>Moreover, research collaborations have provided the NCRNT with access to visibility that facilitates Tribal
	resilience. The NCRNTs partnership with CDA Collaborative Learning regarding Indigenous resilience to conflict and
	climate change has offered the Tribe a platform for visibility beyond the local and national context. As noted by
	Lindroth and Sinevaara-Niskanen however, one risk of these types of projects is that they represent the necessity of
	Indigenous groups accommodating themselves to “[settler] political and legal frameworks by constantly offering
	evidence that validates their existence and causes.”
	<a href="#_ftn92" title="" name="_ftnref92"> [92] </a> This risk is of course reflected in the evidence requirements
	that the Tribe must meet in its fight for federal recognition. It is also not hard to see how the NCRNT research
	collaboration with CDA could reflect the same risk. By working with CDA to provide examples of resilience strategies
	that can inform the work of global development practitioners, the NCRNT are offering evidence that reinforces their
	existence and legitimacy at the national and international level. This is not necessarily a destructive process for
	groups like the NCRNT.
	<a href="#_ftn93" title="" name="_ftnref93"> [93] </a> As a small unrecognized nation, such collaborations and
	visibility can lead to significant opportunities for external capacity support outside of the U.S. government, which
	may therefore provide the Tribe with other alternatives to recognition.
	<a href="#_ftn94" title="" name="_ftnref94"> [94] </a> The collaboration with CDA also highlights the value and
	significance of engaging with Indigenous histories for informing understandings of resilience. By collaborating with
	CDA and sharing their unique experience of resilience at the local, national, and global level, the NCRNT provided
	practical evidence to inform normative shifts in the concept and practical application of resilience within
	international development.  As a result, and in the absence of federal recognition, the NCRNT has therefore deployed
	its own visibility as a method for constructing and implementing an alternative concept of resilience that reflects
	its historic oppression and the ideals of a ‘new normal.’
</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Conclusion </h1>
<p>This examination of the Nevada City Rancheria Nisenan Tribe’s resilience strategies reveals the necessity of framing
	resilience through histories of oppression and the concept of restorative justice. The NCRNT’s experience reflects the
	flaws of existing resilience frameworks that focus narrowly on ‘bouncing back’ without addressing root causes of
	marginalization. For the NCRNT, there is no ‘normal’ state to return to after two centuries of genocide, land
	dispossession, and denial of sovereignty. The Tribe’s goal is not recovery but forging new futures that enable NCRNT
	revival through visibility. By creatively leveraging cultural preservation efforts, arts, and non-Native
	collaboration, the NCRNT has augmented constrained pathways for recognition. This multi-pronged approach strengthens
	internal Tribal preservation, non-Native relations, and governance partnerships, while seeking U.S. acknowledgement as
	a parallel process. The NCRNT’s self-defined resilience, centered on visibility and reciprocal healing, provides a
	model for how international development actors can expand rigid resilience frameworks focused on short-term
	stabilization. The NCRNT resilience “strategy” reveals how marginalized communities carve space for agency when formal
	structures are inaccessible. By making their erasure visible across various realms, the NCRNT shapes visibility into a
	pathway for reasserting identity, rights, and collective futures. Their approach points to the emancipatory potential
	of visibility as a critical element of Indigenous self-determination and sovereignty within international development.

	<a href="#_ftnref2" title="" name="_ftn2"> [2] </a> For nearly 30 years, CDA Collaborative Learning has been working
	collaboratively with affected populations and indigenous communities across the globe to develop inclusive and
	culturally sensitive approaches to humanitarian and development challenges. The workshop in California was part of a
	larger collaborative learning project, that had also worked with indigenous communities in Fiji, and is set to work
	with at least 14 other communities across the globe to develop frameworks for programming in climate affected and
	fragile environments. CDA was originally established as the “Collaborative for Development Action” in 1985 and changed
	to “CDA Collaborative Learning Projects” in 2003. CDA is best known for their development of the “Do No Harm” approach
	to peacebuilding policy and practice. For example, see: Mary B. Anderson, <em>Do No Harm: How Aid Can Support Peace–or
		War</em> (Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1999).

	<a href="#_ftnref39" title="" name="_ftn39"> [39] </a> ‘Slow violence’, a term first coined by Rob Nixon refers to
	“violence that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and
	space, an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all.” Nixon uses this term to refer
	primarily to environmental violence, such as the disproportionate impacts of climate change and environmental toxicity
	via the fossil fuel industry on certain communities. I argue that this concept can be applied to the structural
	legacies of past U.S. Indian policy and the effects these have had and continue to have on contemporary Indian lives,
	particularly regarding the implications of denied federal recognition and land rematriation. Rather than being used as
	a replacement for other frameworks of violence, ‘slow violence’ will be used to augment traditional understandings of
	violence that tend to frame it as primarily acute, physical (or structural), and time bound. For resources on slow
	violence, see: Jenna Marie Christian and Lorraine Dowler, “Slow and Fast Violence,” <em>ACME: An International Journal

	<a href="#_ftnref62" title="" name="_ftn62"> [62] </a> The sale of the rancheria and termination of the Tribe under
	these circumstances is problematic for two reasons. First, the termination act conflated the political identity and
	federal trust relationship with the Nevada City Nisenan with the Nevada City Rancheria land, which had been bifurcated
	previously through the executive order reservation and through the Tribe’s organization under the IRA. As such, the
	sale of the Rancheria should not have been conflated with the termination of the Tribe’s federal recognition.
	Furthermore, both the IRA and the 1958 California Rancheria Act required that a majority of adult tribal members vote
	to terminate an IRA tribe’s federal recognition. Because only two of the Tribe’s members voted to sell the rancheria,
	and no majority vote was ever held regarding the termination of recognition, the Tribe’s status as a federally
	unrecognized tribe is therefore legally undetermined.

	<a href="#_ftnref87" title="" name="_ftn87"> [87] </a> A part of federal recognition is the ability of tribes to

	(University of Toronto Press, 2010); Lori Lambert, <em>Research for Indigenous Survival: Indigenous Research

	narratives of tribes like the NCRNT that are not reflective of their realities and that serve to reinforce settler
	narratives of Indigeneity, for instance see: Lindroth and Sinevaara-Niskanen, “Colonialism Invigorated?”; Lindroth and
	Sinevaara-Niskanen, <em>Global Politics and Its Violent Care for Indigeneity</em>. For research on the NCRNT that was

	<a href="#_ftnref94" title="" name="_ftn94"> [94] </a> This is in contrast to authors such as Audra Simpson who
	critique anthropological visibility and argue for &quot;refusal&quot; as a strategy to protect indigenous knowledges
	and ways of being. For example, see: Simpson, “On Ethnographic Refusal”; In contrast, the NCRNT visibility efforts
	provide further evidence to existing scholarship on Indigenous visibility efforts as a source of Indigenous survival
	and resilience. For instance, for discussion of indigenous-led efforts to remake visibility on their own terms within
	Museums, see: Amy Lonetree, <em>Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums</em>
